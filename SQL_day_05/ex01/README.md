## Exercise 01 - How to see that index works?

== TASK ==

Before further steps please write a SQL statement that returns pizzas’ and corresponding pizzeria names. Please take a look at the sample result below (no sort needed).

| pizza_name | pizzeria_name | 
| ------ | ------ |
| cheese pizza | Pizza Hut |
| ... | ... |

Let’s provide proof that your indexes are working for your SQL.
The sample of proof is the output of the `EXPLAIN ANALYZE` command. 
Please take a look at the sample output command.
    
    ...
    ->  Index Scan using idx_menu_pizzeria_id on menu m  (...)
    ...
