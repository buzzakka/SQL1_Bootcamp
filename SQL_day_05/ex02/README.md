## Exercise 02 - Formula is in the index. Is it Ok?

== TASK ==

Please create a functional B-Tree index with name `idx_person_name` for the column name of the `person` table. Index should contain person names in upper case. 

Please write and provide any SQL with proof (`EXPLAIN ANALYZE`) that index idx_person_name is working.
