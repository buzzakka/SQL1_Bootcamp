## Exercise 03 - “Hidden” Insights

== TASK ==

Please write a SQL statement which returns common rows for attributes order_date, person_id from `person_order` table from one side and visit_date, person_id from `person_visits` table from the other side (please see a sample below). In other words, let’s find identifiers of persons, who visited and ordered some pizza on the same day. Actually, please add ordering by action_date in ascending mode and then by person_id in descending mode.

| action_date | person_id |
