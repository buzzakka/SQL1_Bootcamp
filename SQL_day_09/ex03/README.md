## Exercise 03 - Generic Audit

== TASK ==

Actually, there are 3 triggers for one `person` table. Let’s merge all our logic to the one main trigger with the name `trg_person_audit` and a new corresponding trigger function `fnc_trg_person_audit`.

Other words, all DML traffic (`INSERT`, `UPDATE`, `DELETE`) should be handled from the one functional block. Please explicitly define a separated IF-ELSE block for every event (I, U, D)!

Additionally, please take the steps below .
- to drop 3 old triggers from the person table.
- to drop 3 old trigger functions
- to make a `TRUNCATE` (or `DELETE`) of all rows in our `person_audit` table

When you are ready, please re-apply the set of DML statements.
`INSERT INTO person(id, name, age, gender, address)  VALUES (10,'Damir', 22, 'male', 'Irkutsk');`
`UPDATE person SET name = 'Bulat' WHERE id = 10;`
`UPDATE person SET name = 'Damir' WHERE id = 10;`
`DELETE FROM person WHERE id = 10;`
